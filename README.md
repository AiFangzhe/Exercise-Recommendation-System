# Exercise-Recommendation-System
we build a student simulator with our concept-aware deep knowledge tracing model, and then use it to train a flexible and scalable personalized exercise recommendation policy with deep reinforcement learning
## Knowledge Tracing Model
We propose a new exercise-level deep knowledge tracing model whose structure is built based on the course's concept list, and the exercise-concept mapping relationships are utilized during students' knowledge tracing. The model supports more input features and obtains higher performance compared with existing models.
## Exercises Recommendation
We propose an exercises recommendation algorithm which uses model-free reinforcement learning with neural network function approximation to learn an exercise recommendation policy. The policy directly operates on raw observations of a student's exercise history. Experimental results show that our policy achieves better performance than existing heuristic policy in terms of maximizing students' knowledge level.
